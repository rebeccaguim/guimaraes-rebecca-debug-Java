# Java Symptom Analytics – Project 2 (OpenClassrooms)

##  Training Context

This project was completed as part of the **Java Developer Path** on **OpenClassrooms**.  
It is the **Project 2: "Debug a Java application"**, presented as a **professional simulation**.  

In this scenario, I was hired as an intern at **Heme Biotech**, a fictional pharmaceutical company, and was tasked with correcting and improving an existing Java application used to analyze patient symptoms.

##  Project Goal

The objective is to correct and refactor an existing Java application that:
-  Reads symptom data from a text file (`symptoms.txt`)
-  Counts the number of times each symptom appears
-  Generates a new output file named `result.out` that lists each symptom in **alphabetical order**, followed by the number of occurrences
